This repository features 2 versions of my working algorithmic trading bots.

DISCLAIMER: I have been programming python for <6 months, I intend to improve with each project.

The first version 'my_bot.py' was my first working trading bot, it created signals from raw price data and executed trades accordingly, however, this was not the easiest program to manipulate, as it was relatively messy and uncoordinated.

After this, I began learning about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), at this point, I decided to refactor my bot into the OOP style, which I've found to be much better for larger and/more datasets. As well as this, using classes allows me to easily adjust different variables in the program, like changing strategies.

The file 'my_bot(OOP-refactor).py' contains the refactored bot, however this is hardly finalised and I intend to continue developing both my strategies and programming capabilities.
